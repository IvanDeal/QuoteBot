# QuoteBot
Repo for a discord bot to record, store and dispense on request custom quotes defined by users

Discord bot is built in node.js.

Latest version of the code is a refactored version of the original core features related to logging and retrieving quotes from files.

Future plans
I may re-code some of the extended features in the future but for now this project is considered complete.
